                                            the 2002–03 UEFA Champions League. The match was contested by two Italian
                                            teams: Juventus and Milan. The match made history as it was the first time
                                            two clubs from Italy had faced each other in the final. It was also the
                                            second intra-national final of the competition, following the all-Spanish
                                            2000 UEFA Champions League Final three years earlier. Milan won the match
                                            via a penalty shoot-out after the game had finished 0–0 after extra time. It
                                            gave Milan their sixth success in the European Cup.

                                            against Spanish side Valencia. The match finished in a 1–1 draw, but Bayern
                                            clinched their fourth title by winning 5–4 on penalties. This was also their
                                            first European Cup title in a quarter-century, also representing Valencia's
                                            second consecutive final defeat (2000 and 2001). As all the goals in the

                                The UEFA Champions League (abbreviated as UCL) is an annual club football competition
                                organised by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) and contested by
                                top-division European clubs, deciding the competition winners through a round robin
                                group stage to qualify for a double-legged knockout format, and a single leg final. It
                                is one of the most prestigious football tournaments in the world and the most
                                prestigious club competition in European football, played by the national league
                                champions (and, for some nations, one or more runners-up) of their national
                                associations.

                                Introduced in 1955 as the Coupe des Clubs Champions Européens (French for European
                                Champion Clubs' Cup), and commonly known as the European Cup, it was initially a
                                straight knockout tournament open only to the champions of Europe's domestic leagues,
                                with its winner reckoned as the European club champion. The competition took on its
                                current name in 1992, adding a round-robin group stage in 1991 and allowing multiple
                                entrants from certain countries since 1997. It has since been expanded, and while
                                most of Europe's national leagues can still only enter their champion, the strongest
                                leagues now provide up to four teams. Clubs that finish next-in-line in their
                                national league, having not qualified for the Champions League, are eligible for the
                                second-tier UEFA Europa League competition, and from 2021, teams not eligible for the
                                UEFA Europa League will qualify for a new third-tier competition called the UEFA Europa
                                Conference League.

                                In its present format, the Champions League begins in late June with a preliminary
                                round, three qualifying rounds and a play-off round, all played over two legs. The six
                                surviving teams enter the group stage, joining 26 teams qualified in advance. The 32
                                teams are drawn into eight groups of four teams and play each other in a double
                                round-robin system. The eight group winners and eight runners-up proceed to the knockout
                                phase that culminates with the final match in late May or early June. The winner of
                                the Champions League qualifies for the following year's Champions League, the UEFA Super
                                Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup.

                                Spanish clubs have the highest number of victories (18 wins), followed by England (14
                                wins) and Italy (12 wins). England has the largest number of winning teams, with five
                                clubs having won the title. The competition has been won by 22 clubs, 13 of which have
                                won it more than once and eight successfully defended their title. Real Madrid is the
                                most successful club in the tournament's history, having won it 13 times, including its
                                first five seasons and also three in a row from 2016 to 2018. Bayern Munich remains to
                                be the only club to have won all of their matches in a single tournament en route to
                                their cup victory in the 2019–2020 season. Chelsea are the reigning champions, having
                                beaten Manchester City 1–0 in the 2021 final.
