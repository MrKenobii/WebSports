                                            Milwaukee and Phoenix were two of five teams in the league with an active
                                            championship drought of 50 years or more. Prior to 2021, the Bucks
                                            won their only title in 1971, while the Suns have yet to win a title since
                                            joining the league in 1968. They were both making their third Finals
                                            appearance. Phoenix and Milwaukee each began play as expansion teams in
                                            1968. Both teams were involved in a coin toss for the rights to the first
                                            overall pick in the 1969 NBA draft, which the Bucks won and used to select
                                            Lew Alcindor, later known as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, from UCLA.</p>

                                        <p>
                                            The Lakers were coming off of a disappointing season in 2018–19 in which
                                            they extended their playoff drought which began in 2014. Their major
                                            free agent acquisition, LeBron James, suffered the first major injury in his
                                            career, and he missed the playoffs for the first time since 2005. On the
                                            final day of the season, Magic Johnson resigned as president of basketball
                                            operations, and head coach Luke Walton and the team mutually agreed to
                                            part ways a few days later. During the offseason, general manager Rob
                                            Pelinka hired Frank Vogel as the Lakers' new head coach, and he acquired
                                            six-time All-Star power forward Anthony Davis from the New Orleans Pelicans
                                            in a three-way trade that also included the Washington Wizards.

                                            The Raptors lost Game 1 of the first round to the Orlando Magic, but then
                                            they won the next four games in a row and won the series in five games.
                                            After trailing 2–1 against the Philadelphia 76ers in the Eastern Conference
                                            semifinals, they defeated them in seven games, with Leonard hitting the
                                            game-winner at the buzzer as the ball bounced four times on the rim before
                                            falling in, the first buzzer beater in a Game 7 in the NBA playoffs.
                                            Toronto advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals to face the Milwaukee
                                            Bucks. Despite trailing 2–0, the Raptors won the next four games to advance
                                            to the Finals in six games, as Leonard outplayed the Bucks' Giannis
                                            Antetokounmpo, who won league MVP that season. This was their first trip
                                            to the NBA Finals in franchise history, breaking a 25-year drought.</p>

                                            through the season on January 22, 2016, the Cavaliers fired head coach David
                                            Blatt. Associate head coach Tyronn Lue was then promoted to replace
                                            Blatt. General Manager David Griffin cited "a lack of fit with our personnel

                                            They then advanced to the Finals after sweeping both the Detroit Pistons in

                                            were the first team in history to go to two consecutive NBA Finals with

                            <p class="text-white">
                                The National Basketball Association (NBA) is a professional basketball league in North
                                America. The league is composed of 30 teams (29 in the United States and 1 in Canada)
                                and is one of the four major professional sports leagues in the United States and
                                Canada. It is the premier men's professional basketball league in the world.

                                The league was founded in New York City on June 6, 1946, as the Basketball Association
                                of America (BAA). It changed its name to the National Basketball Association on
                                August 3, 1949, after merging with the competing National Basketball League (NBL).
                                The NBA's regular season runs from October to April, with each team playing 82 games.
                                The league's playoff tournament extends into June. As of 2020, NBA players are the
                                world's best paid athletes by average annual salary per player.

                                The NBA is an active member of USA Basketball (USAB), which is recognized by the FIBA
                                (International Basketball Federation) as the national governing body for basketball in
                                the United States. The league's several international as well as individual team offices
                                are directed out of its head offices in Midtown Manhattan, while its NBA Entertainment
                                and NBA TV studios are directed out of offices located in Secaucus, New Jersey.

                                In North America, the NBA is the third wealthiest professional sport league after the
                                National Football League (NFL) and Major League Baseball (MLB) by revenue, and among the
                                top four in the world.
                                It was founded in 1946 by owners of the major ice
                                hockey arenas in the Northeastern and Midwestern United States and Canada. On November
                                1, 1946, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the Toronto Huskies hosted the New York
                                Knickerbockers at Maple Leaf Gardens, in a game the NBA now refers to as the first game
                                played in NBA history. The first basket was made by Ossie Schectman of the
                                Knickerbockers. Although there had been earlier attempts at professional basketball
                                leagues, including the American Basketball League and the NBL, the BAA was the first
                                league to attempt to play primarily in large arenas in major cities. During its early
                                years, the quality of play in the BAA was not significantly better than in competing
                                leagues or among leading independent clubs such as the Harlem Globetrotters. For
                                instance, the 1948 ABL finalist Baltimore Bullets moved to the BAA and won that league's
                                1948 title, and the 1948 NBL champion Minneapolis Lakers won the 1949 BAA title. Prior
                                to the 1948–49 season, however, NBL teams from Fort Wayne, Indianapolis, Minneapolis,
                                and Rochester jumped to the BAA, which established the BAA as the league of choice for
                                collegians looking to turn professional.
